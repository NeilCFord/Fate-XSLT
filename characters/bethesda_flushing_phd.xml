  <description>
      Dr. Flushing is a fellow at the Institute for Gravitical and Electro-Mechanical Advancement (IGEMA),
      and is one IGEMA's lead test engineers and field agents. IGEMA is frequently in conflict with agents
      of various international organizations who seek to steal their technology, take over the world, or both.
      Gustav von Stendahl, leader of a shadowy spy agency of uncertain affiliation, is frequently a thorn in
      her side. Dr. Flushing has bright red hair and is never without several gadgets, including her helicopter pack.
