     As long as you're not being directly observed and there's a responsible

 <notes>
  Regardless of what modes you have, if they're all standard modes you get ONE of the following improvements:
  * Specialize one trained skill.
  * Focus one trained skill and specialize one focused skill.
  * Focus three trained skills.

  If one of your modes is Science, also apply ALL of the following improvements:
  * Specialize one trained skill.
  * Focus one trained skill.
  * Specialize one focused skill.

  Probably increase Ecology, Biology within Science
